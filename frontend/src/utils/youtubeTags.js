/**
 * Parse `[[[PLAY: <videoId>]]]` tags out of an agent message.
 *
 * The backend's music-playback skill (backend/tools/media_server.py and
 * backend/.fast-agent/skills/music-playback/SKILL.md) emits this tag when
 * the agent decides to play a YouTube video. The frontend's job is to:
 *
 *   1. Strip the literal tag from the displayed bubble text.
 *   2. Render an embedded YouTube player below the message for each id.
 *
 * Why a regex instead of a markdown extension: the tag format is fixed by
 * the backend contract and never appears mid-word; a single regex pass is
 * trivial to verify and keeps the rendering surface free of new deps.
 *
 * Video IDs follow YouTube's own format: 11 chars from [A-Za-z0-9_-].
 * We allow 6–32 chars to stay forgiving for test fixtures and possible
 * format changes, while still rejecting obviously bogus payloads.

  // ``allow`` attribute; the URL param is the missing half.
