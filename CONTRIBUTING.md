# Contributing to Jarvis

Thanks for your interest! This project is in active development and contributions are welcome.

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Before you start

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/omnigentx/jarvis/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/omnigentx/jarvis/pulls) to avoid duplicate work.
- For usage questions, ideas, or open-ended discussion, prefer [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omnigentx/jarvis/discussions) over filing an issue.
- For substantial changes (new agents, new MCP tools, architecture shifts), open a discussion or issue first so we can align on direction.
- Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`backend/ADDING_AGENT_GUIDE.md`](backend/ADDING_AGENT_GUIDE.md) — they explain how the spawn system, agent cards, and MCP tool servers fit together.

## Dev setup

```bash
# Clone with submodules (fast-agent, figma-ui-mcp, mcp-atlassian, realtimestt_src, realtimetts_src).
# Use the upstream URL for read-only work; clone your own fork if you plan to push.
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/omnigentx/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# Configure secrets (do not commit)
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp backend/fastagent.secrets.yaml.example backend/fastagent.secrets.yaml
# Edit both files with your API keys

# Bring the stack up
docker compose up -d --build

# Run backend tests
cd backend && uv run pytest

# Run frontend tests (one-time: `npx playwright install chromium` for E2E)
cd ../frontend && npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e
```

### Native dev (no Docker)

Two terminals — the Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (FastAPI + fast-agent)
cd backend
uv sync                                      # one-time + after submodule changes
uv run uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
npm install                                  # one-time
npm run dev                                  # → http://localhost:3000
```

- Backend reads `backend/.env`, DB, and the submodule paths in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv.sources]` (editable installs of `fast-agent`, `realtimestt_src`, `realtimetts_src`).
- The frontend auto-reads `VITE_JARVIS_API_KEY` from `frontend/.env` if present (sets `localStorage.jarvis_api_key` for you on first load); otherwise the Setup Wizard captures it interactively.
- VoiceBar (`/ws/voice`) needs the `/ws` Vite proxy entry (already in `vite.config.js`). Browsers treat `http://localhost` as a secure context so `getUserMedia` works without HTTPS.
- After pulling in submodule updates: `git submodule update --init --recursive && (cd backend && uv sync)`.

## Branch & commit conventions

- Work on a feature branch off `main`. Keep branches focused.
- Commit messages: short imperative subject ("fix race in spawn registry"), longer body for "why" if needed.
- Squash trivial fixup commits before opening a PR.

## Code style

- **Python**: follow surrounding style. The repo uses `ruff` and type hints where present — match what you see in the file.
- **TypeScript / Vue**: keep frontend components small; prefer composition API.

## Pull request checklist

Before requesting review:

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`uv run pytest` for backend, `npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e` for frontend)
- [ ] No secrets, hardcoded paths, or personal info introduced
- [ ] Updated docs / SKILL.md / `.env.example` if behavior or config changed
- [ ] PR description explains *why*, not just *what*

## Submodules

`backend/fast-agent`, `backend/figma-ui-mcp`, `backend/mcp-atlassian`, `backend/realtimestt_src`, and `backend/realtimetts_src` are pinned submodules (the last two are forks of `KoljaB/RealtimeSTT` / `KoljaB/RealtimeTTS` under `omnigentx`; the path is intentionally not the package name so cwd doesn't shadow the editable install). If you need to change code inside a submodule:

1. Open a PR in the submodule's own repo.
2. After it merges, bump the submodule pointer in `jarvis` with a follow-up PR.

Do **not** commit modifications inside submodule directories from the parent repo.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue with:

- A minimal reproduction
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Logs (`docker compose logs jarvis-backend`) or stack traces
- Environment (host OS, Docker version, branch / commit)

## Reporting security issues

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Don't file public issues for vulnerabilities.
