"""CSRF protection (double-submit cookie pattern).

How it works
------------

1. ``POST /api/auth/login`` succeeds → backend sets two cookies:

   * ``jarvis_session`` — httpOnly, signed (see :mod:`core.session`).
   * ``jarvis_csrf``    — readable from JS, random per session.

2. The dashboard reads ``jarvis_csrf`` and echoes the value back in an
   ``X-CSRF-Token`` header on every state-changing request.
3. This middleware fails any mutation whose header is missing or does
   not match the cookie value.

Why double-submit and not synchronizer-token?
---------------------------------------------

We're stateless on purpose (no DB lookup per request).  Same-Site=Lax
on the cookies blocks the basic cross-site form-POST attack; the
header check kills the remaining ``<img src=...>`` / fetch
no-cors / cross-origin XHR vectors that can plant a request but cannot
read the cookie value.

Scope of protection
-------------------

This middleware ONLY defends **cookie-authenticated** callers. The
double-submit pattern works by checking that a request's
``X-CSRF-Token`` header matches the ``jarvis_csrf`` cookie — a value
the browser will auto-attach but a third-party origin cannot read.

**Bearer / query-param callers (Xiaozhi, automation scripts) carry no
CSRF cookie**, so they are intentionally allowed through
this middleware. They have a different threat model: the caller owns
the long-lived API key, so request-forgery in the browser sense
doesn't apply. Their own client code is responsible for not handing
the key to untrusted JS.

If a future change tightens this — e.g., requiring CSRF on Bearer
mutations too — Xiaozhi and any custom automation will start
returning 403. That's a breaking change; coordinate with the
programmatic-client owners first.

Exemptions
----------

* ``GET / HEAD / OPTIONS`` are always allowed.
* The auth bootstrap endpoints (``/api/auth/login``,
  ``/api/auth/passkey/authenticate/*``, ``/api/setup/...``) are exempt because
  the user has not yet been issued a (valid) CSRF cookie at that point — a
  stale cookie from an expired session must not block re-login. Passkey
  authenticate is defended by WebAuthn's own challenge/signature; ``login`` is
  rate-limited per-IP and same-origin enforced by SameSite=Lax. Passkey
  REGISTER stays protected (needs an authenticated session).
* OAuth callback endpoints (``/api/oauth/.../callback``) are exempt —
  third-party redirect cannot carry our header.  Those routes have
  their own ``state``-parameter CSRF defence.
