"""/ws/voice — bidirectional real-time voice transport.

The browser opens ONE WebSocket per hands-free session. Frames:

* **Client → Server (binary)**: 16 kHz mono int16 PCM frames captured by an
  AudioWorklet.
* **Client → Server (text JSON)**: control messages —
    - ``{"type":"start"}`` accepted-and-ignored (handshake)
    - ``{"type":"stop"}`` close session
    - ``{"type":"barge_in"}`` cancel in-flight agent + TTS
    - ``{"type":"speak","text":"..."}`` speak arbitrary text (manual probe)
    - ``{"type":"set_session","id":"..."}`` resume an existing chat session
* **Server → Client (text JSON)**: STT events (``partial_transcript``,
  ``stable_transcript``, ``final_transcript``, ``vad_start``, ``vad_stop``,
  ``recording_start``, ``recording_stop``, ``wake_word``), TTS events
  (``tts_start``, ``tts_end``, ``tts_interruption``, ``barge_in_ack``),
  conversation events (``user_message``, ``agent_thinking``,
  ``assistant_message``, ``session``, ``error``), tool-call events
  forwarded from the chat progress hooks so the dashboard renders the
  same tool bubbles as text chat (``tool_request``, ``tool_done``,
  ``tool_running``), lifecycle events (``stt_loading``, ``stt_ready``).
* **Server → Client (binary)**: TTS audio bytes (raw PCM 24 kHz int16 for
  RealtimeTTS engines, MP3 for the legacy Edge provider — client sniffs).

Conversation flow (RealtimeVoiceChat-inspired):

1. Browser captures mic → PCM → WS in.
2. STT recorder runs ``recorder.text()`` in a daemon loop, drives VAD.
3. ``recording_start`` fires → user is talking → cancel any in-flight
   agent reply + TTS (barge-in).
4. ``post_speech_silence_duration`` (0.7s default) of silence → recorder
   produces a final transcript via ``on_final``.
5. Final transcript → submit to fast-agent via ``session_service.resume_and_send``.
6. Agent reply → echo as ``assistant_message`` event + ``speak()`` over WS.
7. Loop.

Why one socket: half-duplex would force tracking two ids; a single socket
keeps barge-in latency low — VAD start instantly cancels in-process
without a round-trip.
