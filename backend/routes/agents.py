    """Derive effective status from multi-signal evidence.

    Background (the 2026-05-11 ``running``-stuck-forever UI bug):
    ``spawn_registry.status`` is updated only via the spawn-event bridge
    socket. If that socket dies (R1/R2 race, subprocess SIGKILL'd before
    emitting final event), the DB value can be frozen at ``running``
    indefinitely while the agent has actually exited or gone idle.

    Instead of trusting the single bridge-fed field, cross-check with:

    * **Channel sock probe** — file present + connect-test succeeds ⇒
      subprocess is alive (sitting in keep-alive ``listen()``).
    * **Latest agent snapshot** — the subprocess writes its
      ``trigger`` (``task_complete`` / ``idle`` / ``error``) and
      ``created_at`` DIRECTLY to SQLite, bypassing the bridge entirely.
      That is our most trustworthy "what is the agent actually doing"
      signal.
    * **``record.last_active_at``** — the bridge updates this on every
      thinking/tool_call/tool_result/response event. Compared against
      the snapshot's ``created_at`` it tells us whether the latest idle
      snapshot is fresh or stale-from-a-prior-turn.

    All values returned are members of the canonical ``SpawnStatus``
    set used by the bridge and startup cleanup
    (``mark_stale_running``) so consumers do not see novel values.
    Decision tree (only overrides the mutable states ``running`` /
    ``starting`` / ``resumed`` / ``idle`` / ``pending`` / ``unknown`` —
    terminal states like ``completed`` / ``error`` / ``paused`` are
    trusted as-is):

    Channel alive (subprocess in keep-alive):
      * snapshot trigger ∈ {task_complete, idle} AND
        snapshot.created_at >= record.last_active_at  → ``idle``
        (subprocess wrote the idle snapshot AFTER its last bridge-
        relayed activity event ⇒ genuinely idle now, not mid-turn).
      * Otherwise → keep raw (likely mid-LLM call: prior idle snapshot
        is stale relative to current activity).

    Channel dead (subprocess exited):
      * trigger = ``error`` → ``error``.
      * trigger ∈ {task_complete, idle}:
          - lifecycle ``oneshot`` → ``completed`` (one-and-done done).
          - lifecycle ``resumable`` / missing → ``idle``. The agent is
            hibernating: ``auto_wake_if_idle`` respawns it from snapshot
            on the next inbound message. This matches the canonical
            rule already enforced by ``spawn_progress_bridge`` (live
            ``result`` event) and ``mark_stale_running`` (startup
            cleanup) — see those for the same ``"idle" if lifecycle ==
            "resumable" else "completed"`` pattern.
      * No snapshot trigger → keep raw. Could be the spawn race window
        (channel not yet bound, no snapshot yet) or a true crash with
        no terminal event. Without snapshot evidence we cannot
        distinguish; ``mark_stale_running`` will flip to idle/completed
        on the next backend restart.

    Probe exception → keep raw (don't invent a state from a failed
    probe).
