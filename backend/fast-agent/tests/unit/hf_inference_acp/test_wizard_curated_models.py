"""
Testing notes:

- This module owns the HuggingFace ACP wizard's curated-model smoke tests.
- Exact option ordering is only asserted where numbered wizard selection depends
  on that ordering as a user-visible contract.
- Prefer membership and flow-transition checks over duplicating the full
  curated model list.
