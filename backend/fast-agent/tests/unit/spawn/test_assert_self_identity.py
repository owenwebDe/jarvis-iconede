"""Submodule-local tests for the shared identity check.

The parent jarvis repo carries the end-to-end contract tests; this file
covers the helper in isolation so a regression in fast-agent surfaces
at submodule CI time instead of only when the parent repo bumps the
pointer.

Contract (see ``_team_helpers.assert_self_identity``):

- ``claimed_name=""`` → auto-detect, no impersonation risk
- ``claimed_name`` set + ``TEAM_MY_NAME`` matches → allow
- ``claimed_name`` set + ``TEAM_MY_NAME`` mismatch → REFUSE
- ``claimed_name`` set + ``TEAM_MY_NAME`` unset → REFUSE

No permissive escape hatch.
