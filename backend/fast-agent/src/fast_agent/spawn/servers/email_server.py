"""Email MCP Server — async inter-agent messaging.

Provides send_email tool for inter-agent messaging.
Teammate status is auto-delivered via consolidated team notifications.
Email delivery to agents is handled automatically via RTAC (InboxWatcherHook)
and the keep-alive loop — agents never need to poll their inbox.
