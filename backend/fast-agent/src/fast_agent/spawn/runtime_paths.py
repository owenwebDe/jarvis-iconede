"""Central path constants for all spawn runtime artifacts.

All runtime-generated files live under .runtime/ with semantic subdirectories:
  - state/  — persistent across sessions (messages, runs, registry)
  - cache/  — ephemeral, safe to delete (tmp, logs)
  - data/   — user-facing output (agent_cards, workspaces)

The ``project_dir`` must be provided by the caller (the host application)
since this module lives inside the library, not the project itself.
