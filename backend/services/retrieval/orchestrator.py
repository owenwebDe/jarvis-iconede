"""Retrieval orchestrator — ties the router, providers, fusion, budget, cache,
ledger, and telemetry together (spec §5 read path, §7, §8).

Level 0 returns immediately (no providers touched). Level 1 runs the available
providers in parallel, fuses with RRF + bounded policy, and trims to budget.
Level 2 is a bounded corrective round (deterministic here; an LLM planner can
be injected later via ``planner`` without changing this control flow). Every
retrieval writes a ``retrieval_runs`` telemetry row.
