"""LadybugDB store — the rebuildable graph + vector index for memory v2.

SQLite stays the source of truth (write authority, versions, audit); this store
is a disposable PROJECTION fed by the outbox worker, so adopting an early-stage
embedded graph DB is reversible (rebuild from SQLite if it ever underperforms).

LadybugDB (``ladybug`` pkg, Kùzu-lineage) gives us, in ONE embedded engine:
  - HNSW vector search (``QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX``) for dense recall,
  - a property graph (Memory/Entity nodes, MENTIONS/RELATES edges) for entity
    linking + multi-hop GraphRAG — vector hits feed straight into MATCH.

Owner scoping is a hard invariant: every read filters by ``owner`` so an agent
only ever sees its own memory (mirrors the SQLite rules).
