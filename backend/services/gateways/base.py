"""Gateway abstraction — connect external messaging platforms to Jarvis.

A *gateway* bridges one external chat platform (Telegram, Zalo, …) to the
agent runtime. The design splits two concerns so adding a platform is cheap
and the agent-facing logic lives in exactly one place:

  * **Transport** (subclass responsibility): how to *receive* messages from
    the platform (``run``) and how to *send* a reply (``send_text``). This is
    the only part that differs per platform.

  * **Orchestration** (this base class, ``handle_inbound``): allow-list gate →
    typing indicator → hand the message to the agent via the injected
    ``dispatcher`` → deliver the reply → on failure, log loudly *and* tell the
    user (never a silent swallow).

To add a new platform: subclass :class:`BaseGateway` (or
:class:`~services.gateways.bot_api.BotApiGateway` for any Telegram-style Bot
API), implement the transport methods, and register it in
``services.gateways.registry``. Nothing else in the codebase changes.
