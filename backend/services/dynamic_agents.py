"""Dynamic agent loader & reload service (DB-backed).

Replaces the legacy file-based agent_card loader. Definitions now live
in SQLite (table `agent_definitions`, see ``services.agent_definitions``).
The parent process polls a monotonic ``rev`` counter on that store and
calls ``agent_app.load_agent_data(defs, "Jarvis")`` whenever rev advances,
so subprocess writers (the agent_spawner MCP, REST CRUD endpoints) only
need to bump rev — no signal files, no filesystem watching.

Why poll the DB instead of pushing? Mutations may originate inside
subprocesses (the MCP server runs separately) that don't share Python
state with the parent FastAgent. SQLite is the only state shared across
processes, so polling a meta column is the simplest correct mechanism.
The poll interval is small (2s) — well under interactive expectations
and cheap (one indexed read).

    The rev counter is bumped by:
    - The REST CRUD endpoints (services.agent_definitions.create/update/
      delete) when an operator edits an agent via the dashboard.
    - The `spawn_agent` MCP tool when Jarvis self-creates an agent.

    Both writer paths run in different processes (subprocess MCP) or in
    request handlers that don't hold the FastAgent state, so this loop
    is the converge mechanism. One-shot polling per tick: read rev,
    compare, reload if changed.

    TODO scalability: full-replace reload on every rev bump.
    ``load_agent_data(defs, parent)`` re-sends the entire definitions
    list each tick where rev changed, and fast_agent's replace
    semantics rebuilds every dynamic agent — including ones that
    didn't change. For N=small (today: 0–3 dynamic agents) this is
    cheap. If N grows to dozens with frequent CRUD churn, swap to a
    diff-and-patch path: track a per-name ``rev`` (or
    ``updated_at``), fetch only changed rows, and emit a smaller
    in-memory update. Keep the rev counter as the wake signal so
    cross-process semantics don't change.
