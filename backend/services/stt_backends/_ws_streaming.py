"""Base class for cloud STT backends that stream PCM over a WebSocket.

The scaffolding here is provider-agnostic: thread + asyncio loop hand-off,
audio queue, hook fan-out, mic-driven lifecycle (``pause`` / ``resume``),
infinite reconnect with exponential backoff, ``ws_status`` event emission,
shutdown plumbing. Each cloud provider (Soniox, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, …)
subclasses :class:`WSStreamingSTT` and supplies three small bits:

* ``WS_URL`` — endpoint to connect to
* ``_build_config_message()`` — JSON config sent immediately after connect
* ``_handle_event(data)`` — parse one inbound message and emit events
  (``self._emit_partial``, ``self._emit_final``, ``self._emit_endpoint``)

Optionally ``_on_connected()`` is called on every (re)connect so subclasses
can clear per-session accumulators.

Why a base class instead of free helper functions: the per-instance state
(hook ref, audio queue, asyncio loop, connection-state machine) is the
awkward part to share, and a base class keeps the public surface
(:class:`services.stt_backends.types.STTServiceProtocol`) identical across
providers — the voice WS route never has to special-case which cloud STT
produced the service.

Lifecycle vs Soniox 408 idle timeout
------------------------------------

Soniox closes idle WS with HTTP 408 after ~10 min of no audio. Pre-fix the
base class exited the reconnect loop on ANY clean close — singleton lived
on with a dead inner socket; user audio silently dropped on next utterance.

Fix is two-pronged:

1. **Mic-driven lifecycle**: ``ws_voice`` calls ``pause()`` when the
   frontend disconnects → we close the upstream WS cleanly → Soniox never
   has an idle window. On next mic-on, ``resume()`` opens a fresh WS.

2. **Infinite reconnect**: even if the WS does drop mid-session (network
   blip, Soniox restart), the outer ``while not self._closed`` re-enters
   for both normal close AND exception paths. Only ``shutdown()`` ends
   the loop. Backoff caps at 10 s; after ``ERROR_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES``
   bad attempts in a row we emit ``ws_status: error`` so the route can
   surface a real failure to the user instead of spinning silently.
