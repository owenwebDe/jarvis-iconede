Pause Controller — single source of truth for agent pause/resume.

Lifecycle (Phase 3 — three-state machine + instant LLM pause via task cancel):

    running ──pause()──► pausing ──[hook at checkpoint]──► paused
       ▲                                                     │
       │                                                     │
       └──[hook resumes from await]── resuming ◄──resume()───┘

Why three states (and four SSE events)?
  - ``pausing`` means *the request was received* but the agent is still
    finishing an in-flight LLM/tool call. Frontend renders a spinner.
  - ``paused`` is broadcast *from inside the checkpoint hook*, the
    instant the agent is actually about to ``await``. This is the bug
    fix versus the previous design which broadcast ``agent_paused``
    from ``pause()`` directly — UI would say "Paused" while the agent
    was still streaming an LLM response.
  - ``resuming`` is the mirror state, emitted from ``resume()`` so the
    UI shows a "Resuming…" spinner until the hook wakes back up.
  - ``agent_resumed`` is broadcast from the hook after ``await`` returns
    — i.e. when the agent has genuinely resumed running.

Idle-state edge case::

    pause() on an agent that's not in any in-flight turn → the hook
    will never fire (until the next chat message). We track activity
    via ``_active[name]`` (set True between ``before_llm_call`` and
    ``after_turn_complete``) and emit ``agent_paused`` directly from
    ``pause()`` when ``_active`` is False. Same for resume in reverse.
    Without this the UI would show "Pausing…" indefinitely for idle
    agents, which is functionally incorrect — they ARE paused.

Public API (unchanged from Phase 1)::

    pause_controller.pause("Minh - Dev")
    pause_controller.resume("Minh - Dev")
    pause_controller.is_paused(name)        # boolean
    pause_controller.state_of(name)         # 'running'|'pausing'|'paused'|'resuming'
    hooks = pause_controller.create_pause_hooks("jarvis")

Instant pause for in-flight LLM calls
-------------------------------------
Cooperative pause (block at the next ``before_llm_call`` / ``before_tool_call``
checkpoint) leaves the agent running until the current step finishes —
acceptable for tools (typically <2s, side-effect-bearing so safer to let
finish) but painful for LLM streams (often 10-60s on long responses).

Strategy "B" from the design discussion: cancel mid-LLM-call, leave
tools alone. Implementation:

  1. The pause hook captures ``asyncio.current_task()`` in
     ``_current_tasks[agent_name]`` when ``before_llm_call`` fires.
     The same task ref is used by ``pause()`` to interrupt the LLM stream.
  2. ``pause()`` checks ``_current_tasks[name]``. If a task is registered,
     it calls ``task.cancel()`` *in addition* to clearing the event.
  3. The cancellation surfaces inside ``_tool_runner_llm_step`` as
     ``asyncio.CancelledError``. The tool_runner has a retry loop
     wrapping the LLM call: when the new ``on_pause_cancel`` hook
     (provided by this controller) returns True, the runner calls
     ``task.uncancel()`` and reissues the LLM call with the unchanged
     ``_delta_messages``.
  4. On resume, ``event.set()`` releases the on_pause_cancel hook (which
     was awaiting ``event.wait()``). The retry then proceeds with the
     same state — satisfying requirement #3 ("resume from prior state").

Tool calls are not cancelled — the ``_current_tasks`` ref is cleared on
``after_llm_call`` (i.e. before any tool-call phase begins). Pause during
tool-call falls back to cooperative blocking at the next checkpoint.

Team-wide pause (Phase 4)
-------------------------
``pause(scope)`` accepts either an agent name or a team name. Resolution
goes through ``_resolve_scope``:

  - If ``scope`` is a team name (any spawn_record has that team_name),
    expand to the full membership set. Orchestrator is included because
    the template's orchestrator role is itself a member in the registry.
  - If ``scope`` is an agent name and that agent belongs to a team
    (spawn_record.team_name set), expand to the full team. Implements
    user requirement #4: pausing any member pauses the whole team.
  - Otherwise pause just the single agent (covers in-process Jarvis and
    solo spawns).

Late-joiner protection: ``spawn_progress_bridge`` consults
``is_team_paused`` when registering a new spawn record. If the team
is paused, the controller immediately pauses the joiner so it can't
slip past the pause window between spawn and first checkpoint.

Later phases extend this module with:
  - Phase 5: ``attach(agent, team_name)`` auto-wiring helper
  - Phase 6: restart recovery for manual pauses

        Cascade semantics: ignores ``scope`` for the subagent sweep — we

        the only orchestrator; "running" spawn records by definition belong
        to its current turn. A per-parent filter would need explicit parent
        tracking that the registry doesn't carry today.

        Side-effects already committed by killed subagents (DB writes,
        file writes) are NOT rolled back here — see
        ``backend/utils/compensation.py`` for the per-tool rollback pattern.
        Callers should surface a "N side-effects may have committed"
        warning to the user.

        ⚠️ **Status semantics — "signal sent, not reaped":** the registry
        row is marked ``status="killed"`` IMMEDIATELY after ``os.kill()``
        returns. ``os.kill`` only delivers the signal; it doesn't wait for
        the child to exit. ``uv`` catches SIGTERM and propagates SIGINT to
        the python child, which raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` → graceful
        shutdown. If that hand-off ever breaks (uv quirk, child traps
        SIGINT, signal mask), the registry will *briefly* show
        ``"killed"`` while the process is still alive. Consumers that
        need a hard exit guarantee must poll ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` or rely
        on the subprocess reaper to refresh the row to a final state.
        We don't synchronously wait here because the caller path is
        user-initiated cancel — adding a poll loop would surface as UI
        lag on the Stop button. Re-think this only if a downstream
        consumer materializes that requires synchronous reaping.
