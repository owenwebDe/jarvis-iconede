"""Fast-lane memory extractor — cheap LLM, low context, self-contained facts.

Replaces the brittle embedding-prototype auto-capture (which captured raw user
messages → near-duplicate spam and stored questions as facts). The LLM is the
precise decider: it reads a short recent snippet and extracts DURABLE user
facts / preferences / standing instructions, plus the entities they mention
(for the graph). A frequency gate (debounce, in the caller) controls cost, not a
content classifier. The prompt explicitly rejects trivia, which is what kills
the spam at the source.

The LLM call is injectable (``generate_fn``) so tests drive it with a scripted
PassthroughLLM (true playback — real generate → real parse → real candidate
write), no network.
