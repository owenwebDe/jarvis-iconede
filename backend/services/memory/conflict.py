"""LLM-judged conflict resolution at save time (rare, background, lossless).

ADD-only capture (``candidate_service``) deliberately keeps every fact and never
supersedes at write time — a changed fact (AcmeCorp→NovaCorp) keeps BOTH, dated,
and recency-weighted ranking picks the winner at READ time. That breaks down for
a NEW fact that DIRECTLY contradicts an existing one on the same single-valued
attribute (current employer, home city, name) when both were saved close in time:
recency can't separate them, so recall surfaces both and the agent can only ask
"which is right?" instead of answering.

This module closes that narrow gap. It is the resolver the ``fast_extractor``
docstring already named (``conflict.build_curator``). Design:

  • RARE by a cheap gate: an embedding near-neighbour check fires the LLM ONLY
    when a semantically-close prior fact in the same slot exists. Most saves have
    no near-neighbour → zero LLM cost. The gate threshold is intentionally loose
    (catch candidates); the LLM is the precise decider, so a false gate hit just
    costs one judged "no conflict", never a wrong supersede.
  • ONE small LLM call decides if it is a REAL same-attribute contradiction and
    which existing fact the new one replaces. Facts that can coexist (two skills,
    a second job, unrelated facts) are NOT superseded.
  • LOSSLESS: we ``supersede`` (status change, row + version history kept,
    restorable) — never delete. A wrong call is recoverable, never data loss.
  • OFF THE HOT PATH: scheduled fire-and-forget at persist time (mirrors
    ``knowledge_graph.schedule_extract_and_store``), so it never blocks the write
    or the agent's reply. The next recall simply sees a cleaned slot.

Defence-in-depth: even if this misses (LLM unavailable, gate too tight), the
recall block now stamps each memory's created date (``retrieval_hook``), so the
agent can still recency-tiebreak two conflicting memories itself.

``generate_fn``/``embed_fn`` are injectable so tests drive a scripted LLM +
deterministic vectors with no network and no model load.
