"""Knowledge-graph triple extraction (memory v2 relations layer).

Turns a memory statement into (subject, predicate, object) triples — e.g.
"the user likes pho" → {"s":"User","p":"likes","o":"pho"} — stored on
``MemoryRecord.relations_json`` (SQLite = SoT) and projected to LadybugDB as
RELATES edges so the graph view is a real knowledge graph, not opaque blobs.

Best-effort: a missing/failed LLM yields no triples; never raises into callers.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose, no code fence). Each item:
{"s": "<subject>", "p": "<short predicate>", "o": "<object>"}

Rules:
- Subject ``s`` is almost always "User" (the user) — keep this canonical English label so all the user's facts share ONE super-node. Use a named entity only when the statement is really about that entity (e.g. an employer's address).
- Predicate ``p`` is a SHORT relationship phrase: likes / dislikes / works at / lives in / has / studies / plays / uses / interested in …
- Object ``o`` is a CONCISE noun/entity (a company, a city, a hobby, guitar). Strip explanatory clauses — keep just the entity.
- Split a statement with several facts into several triples.
- Write the predicate and object in the SAME language as the statement (English statement → English triples; do NOT translate to another language).

If nothing extractable, return exactly: []
