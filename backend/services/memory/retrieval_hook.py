"""Auto-inject retrieval hook (spec §6, §7).

A ``before_llm_call`` hook that — when the current turn needs historical
context — retrieves relevant memory and injects a single, self-replacing
evidence block into the agent's message history right before the LLM call.
Runs AFTER the compaction hook (merged on top) so fresh evidence is never
summarized away in the same turn.

Cost model: most turns are Level 0 (no retrieval). The cheap signals
(identifier regex + English lexicon) fire with zero model cost; only when
those are silent does the multilingual embedding gate run (one short-query
embedding). Gated entirely by ``memory.enabled``; best-effort — never breaks
the LLM call.
