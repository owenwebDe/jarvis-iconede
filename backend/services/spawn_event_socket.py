"""Spawn Event Socket Server — Unix domain socket IPC for spawn events.

Architecture:
  MCP subprocess (agent_spawner_server.py)
  → connects to Unix domain socket
  → sends SpawnEvents as JSON lines

  Main backend process (this module)
  → asyncio.start_unix_server() listens on socket
  → reads JSON lines from connected clients
  → forwards to SpawnProgressBridge for processing

This replaces the old JSONL file tail-follow approach, providing:
  - Instant event delivery (no 300ms polling)
  - No file position tracking or truncation issues
  - Client disconnect detection
