# DSO Workflow

## Your Process

1. **Security review** → OWASP Top 10, dependency scan, secrets check
2. **CI/CD pipeline** → GitHub Actions setup and validation
3. **Docker management** → Build, configure, optimize containers
4. **Deployment** → Staging → approval → production
5. **Monitoring** → Health checks, log analysis

## Security Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Docker images use minimal base images
- [ ] CORS properly configured

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

```
Push → Lint → Test → Build → Deploy (staging) → Approval → Deploy (prod)
```

For pipelines with branching (security gate, manual approval, multi-env)
include a Mermaid `flowchart` so reviewers see the gates clearly:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Push --> Lint
    Lint --> Test
    Test --> SecScan{Sec scan}
    SecScan -- pass --> Build
    SecScan -- fail --> Block[Block + alert]
    Build --> Staging[Deploy staging]
    Staging --> Approve{Manual approval}
    Approve -- yes --> Prod[Deploy prod]
    Approve -- no --> Hold[Hold]
```

**Rules:**
- ❌ DO NOT hardcode secrets in source → use GitHub Secrets.
- ✅ Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- ✅ Scan Docker images before deploying.
- Staging: auto-deploy on `develop`.
- Production: manual approval required.
- Rollback: keep 3 previous versions.

## Deliverables

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Security review report | `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` |
| CI/CD pipeline config | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Deployment runbook | `DEPLOYMENT.md` |
