# Team Communication Skill

<violation>
- DO NOT read files, browse code, or run shell commands to "learn" the communication system.
- DO NOT use read_text_file, execute, grep, or any tool other than the communication tools.
- ONLY call directly: `send_email`, `create_meeting`.
- Violating this wastes tokens and slows the request.
</violation>

## ⚡ Auto status notifications

Team-mate results are **auto-delivered** to your inbox once ALL members finish:
- A consolidated report (table) with name, status, summary.
- **Do NOT poll.** Stay focused on your own task; the report arrives when everyone is done.
- If you need richer detail, use `send_email` or `create_meeting` to engage a specific member.

## 📧 Email — async, fire-and-forget

- `send_email(to="Name", body="...", subject="...")` — send to a specific person
- `send_email(to="all", body="...")` — broadcast to the whole team
- Emails from team-mates are **auto-delivered** into your context — no polling required

## Waiting for dependencies

If you need a team-mate's output:
1. Send the request: `send_email(to="Agent Name", body="Please send me <deliverable> when ready", subject="[WAITING] ...")`
2. Move on to other work or finish your current task.
3. When the team-mate replies, you are auto-woken with the content.
4. If you need outputs from several members, call `create_meeting` for a quick sync instead.

## 🎙️ Meeting — real-time decisions

When you receive 🔔 MEETING INVITE → follow the `meeting-participant` skill to join and speak.

## Email discipline

- **Focus on the task first.** Only email when you have a deliverable, are blocked, or spot a critical issue. Do NOT email merely to update status or acknowledge.
- **Concise but complete.** Include enough context. Use subject prefixes: `[DONE]`, `[BLOCKED]`, `[BUG]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[DELIVERABLE]`, `[WAITING]`.
- **Use CC sparingly.** Only CC people who genuinely need to know.
- **Do NOT reply just to acknowledge.** Use `no_reply=True` for FYI messages.
- **Avoid email ping-pong.** If you need back-and-forth, schedule a meeting instead of emailing.

## Completion rules (REQUIRED)

BEFORE going idle or completing work, you MUST:
1. Send a `[DONE]` report to the PM: `send_email(to="Linh - PM", subject="[DONE] <deliverable summary>", body="<list of deliverables, files, outcomes, open items>")`
2. NEVER go idle without sending the report — this is **required**.

## Approval escalation

When your role skill flags a command 🟡 ESCALATE:

1. **Don't run it.** Email PM with subject `[APPROVAL-REQUEST] <summary>` and body containing: exact command, why, risk, alternatives (infra adds: rollback).
2. Wait for `[APPROVED]` / `[DENIED]` reply. PM forwards via `approval-server` MCP.
3. APPROVED → run exactly the command from the request. DENIED → re-plan.

**PM only:** verify the requester's role can do the action (Dev/QE/DSO yes; Designer/BA/SA no — redirect), call `request_approval()`, email back the verdict.
