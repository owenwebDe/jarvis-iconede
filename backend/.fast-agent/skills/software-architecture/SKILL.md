  Architecture design patterns, ADR templates, and quality rules.

# Software Architecture

## Core Principles

### Clean Architecture & DDD
- Domain-driven design with ubiquitous language
- Separate domain entities from infrastructure
- Keep business logic independent of frameworks

### SOLID
- **Single Responsibility** — one reason to change per module
- **Open/Closed** — extend, don't modify
- **Liskov Substitution** — subtypes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation** — specific interfaces over general
- **Dependency Inversion** — depend on abstractions

## Code Quality Rules

- **Early returns** over nested conditions (max 3 levels)
- **Functions** under 50 lines
- **Files** under 200 lines — split if longer
- **Library-first** — search for existing solutions first
- **Rule of Three** — abstract only when pattern proven 3+ times

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ NIH syndrome — use libraries for auth/state/validation
- ❌ Premature optimization — measure first
- ❌ YAGNI — don't build for imaginary requirements
- ❌ God objects — no files with 50+ unrelated functions
- ❌ Generic names: `utils`, `helpers`, `common`

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-[N]: [Decision Title]
## Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated
## Context: [What problem are we solving?]
## Decision: [What we chose and why]
## Consequences: [Trade-offs and impacts]
```

## Diagrams (Mermaid)

The dashboard renders Mermaid blocks inline. Pick the right shape for the question:

- **Component / context** — `flowchart` (LR or TB):

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      Client --> API[(API Gateway)]
      API --> AuthSvc
      API --> OrderSvc
      OrderSvc --> DB[(Postgres)]
  ```

- **Interaction over time** — `sequenceDiagram`:

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
      participant U as User
      participant A as API
      participant D as DB
      U->>A: POST /orders
      A->>D: INSERT
      D-->>A: id
      A-->>U: 201 Created
  ```

- **Data shape / aggregate boundaries** — `classDiagram` or `erDiagram`.

Embed at most one diagram per ADR — pick the view that makes the decision
unambiguous. Skip if a paragraph already does the job.
