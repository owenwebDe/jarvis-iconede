"""TTS chat/stories split — code-level guarantees, not just UX hints.

The whole reason chat and stories use separate provider instances is that
a paid engine selected for chat must NOT silently consume long-form quota
when reading audiobook chapters. These tests pin down the structural
guarantees so a future refactor can't accidentally collapse them.
