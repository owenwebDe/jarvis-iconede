"""Regression tests for ``services.pause_controller.PauseController``.

Guards the resume-doesn't-update-DB-status bug observed during the
2026-05-10 dev session: ``_broadcast_state_change`` looked up the
agent via ``registry_db.list_running()``, which filters to
``status IN ('running', 'pending')``. The resume path runs while the
agent is still ``paused`` in the DB, so the lookup returned no rows
→ ``upsert_record`` was skipped → DB status stayed ``"paused"``
forever. SSE consumers / UI badges then showed the agent as paused
even after in-memory state had flipped back to running.

Fix: use ``find_by_name`` (no status filter), mirroring the pattern
already in ``_find_pid``.
