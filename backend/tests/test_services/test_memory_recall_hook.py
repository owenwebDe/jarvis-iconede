"""Recall v2 — always-retrieve, tail-append, change-gate, provenance.

Drives the REAL ``before_llm_call`` hook (`retrieval_hook.create_memory_retrieval_hooks`)
against a fake agent. Retrieval is stubbed to controlled evidence so the HOOK
LOGIC (not the embedding model) is asserted deterministically. The real
semantic-recall behaviour ("what's my job?" → Software Engineer) is covered by
the gated eval suite where BGE is available.
