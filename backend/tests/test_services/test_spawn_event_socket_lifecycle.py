"""Regression test for spawn-event socket ownership cleanup.

Background: ``services/spawn_event_socket.py`` previously used
unconditional ``unlink(missing_ok=True)`` in both ``start()`` and
``stop()``. When two backend instances ran concurrently (user typed
``uv run uvicorn`` twice without killing the first), this caused:

* **start() clobber** — backend N's ``start()`` would unlink the file
  bound by backend N-1, orphaning every subprocess client connected
  to N-1 (their FD still pointed to N-1's inode, but the path → inode
  mapping in the filesystem now pointed elsewhere or nowhere).
* **stop() clobber** — backend N-1's ``stop()`` would unlink the path
  even though backend N had already taken it over, leaving N with an
  orphan FD and no path that new clients could connect to.

Verified state at fix time (2026-05-12): 4 concurrent uvicorn
processes, ``lsof`` showed 4 different inodes bound to the same path,
``ls`` showed the path did not exist — every subprocess emit_event
was a silent drop, causing the 1h2m Sasha hang root-cause chain.

This file pins the fix:

1. ``start()`` refuses to bind if a live listener already owns the path.
2. ``start()`` removes a stale file (no listener) and binds fresh.
3. ``stop()`` only unlinks if the inode at the path still matches what
   we bound. If a peer has taken over, leave it alone.
