"""Regression test for ``DELETE /api/teams/{team_name}`` cascading
into the ``notifications`` table.

The 2026-05-14 toolset-self-audit incident: a user deleted the
previous day's run via the API, started a fresh team with the same
``team_name``, and never got a completion notification for the new
team. Why: the delete route cleaned spawn_registry, team_sessions,
workspace, messages, and activities — but NOT notifications. The
stale notification carried ``team_name: "toolset-self-audit"`` in
its metadata, and the team-completion bridge's dedupe (pre-fix:
keyed on team_name) matched it and skipped emitting a new one.

This test pins the cleanup contract on the delete route directly so
the dedupe fix and the cleanup fix can both stay healthy
independently.
