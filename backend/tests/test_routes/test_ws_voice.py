We can't exercise faster-whisper or a real audio pipeline in CI, so the test

  * STT callbacks bridged through ``set_hook`` arrive on the wire as JSON
  * the speak() control message routes to the active chat provider and the
    response audio flows back as binary frames
  * barge-in via VAD start cancels in-flight TTS
