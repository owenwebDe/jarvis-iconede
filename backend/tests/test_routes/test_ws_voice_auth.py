"""WebSocket voice auth — three-way precedence (cookie / Bearer / query).

Why a separate file
-------------------
``test_ws_voice.py`` exercises the audio pipeline with auth disabled
(``JARVIS_API_KEY=""`` short-circuits the gate). Auth itself is a
narrow concern with three branches that the audio tests do not cover.
Keeping these in their own file lets a future refactor of either
(audio plumbing vs auth precedence) avoid disturbing the other.

Note on the rejection-path tests
--------------------------------
The route does ``await ws.accept()`` BEFORE checking credentials, then
``ws.close(code=4401)`` on failure. Starlette's TestClient surfaces
the close as a ``WebSocketDisconnect`` raised when the client next
tries to receive — not at connect time. The reject tests assert by
catching that disconnect with the 4401 code, not by ``pytest.raises``
around the ``websocket_connect`` block alone.
