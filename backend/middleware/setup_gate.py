"""HTTP middleware that blocks API traffic until the Setup Wizard is done.

While the wizard is incomplete, any authenticated or anonymous request targeting
an API endpoint other than the wizard/auth bootstrap surface is answered with
``503 Service Unavailable`` + ``X-Setup-Required: true``.  The frontend uses
this signal to redirect the browser to ``/#/setup``.

Non-API paths are always allowed: the SPA needs to fetch its own static assets
to actually render the wizard UI.  OpenAPI surfaces are also always open so the
operator can inspect the API even mid-setup.
